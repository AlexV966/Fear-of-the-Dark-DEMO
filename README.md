The source code components cover the implementation of First Person movement and mechanics, scripted events with game object physics, GUI display, swim physics, checkpoint and respawn management, sound bank implementation, audio game mechanics such as smart randomised emitters, in-game audio triggers, basic AI that follows the player and a sound reflection system that uses ray-casting to calculate audio reflections in a space based on the position of the player relative to the sound emitter.
